# TRAPPED

Will use https://github.com/david-abel/simple_rl/ as the basis for the MDP solver and benchmark problems

Main components

## K calculator
Does a blind search from initial state to calculate the minimum number of actions the defender can take before some specified probability limit is met

## Compilation Generator
Takes as input an MDP, a set of trap states and K and generate a new MDP that satisfies our compilation

## Experiment scripts
Auxilary scripts to run and replicate experiments
